I have a couple of doubtss:
1. Are there are specifications for the models database schema for this secion?
2. Like how there is a heatlhprovider, clinician, user etc, is there another
role called `blog_viewer` or something? When the user is asked to create an
"account", what type of account will this be?
3. Are we concerned about making routes for only the admin side or do we need to create the routes for the user dashboard part as well?
4. I think every blog post having an encoded url will be better. We can
   incorporate the search function and have users search through that. That will
   help keep the consistency of the urls.
